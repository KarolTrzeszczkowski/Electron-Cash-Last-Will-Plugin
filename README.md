## Contract description

Last Will smart contract uses the first working implementation of **looping transactions** <sup>[1](https://honest.cash/pein_sama/spending-constraints-with-op_checkdatasig-172) [2](https://tobiasruck.com/content/lets-play-chess-on-bch/)</sup> for refreshing the contract.

### Smart contract basics
The contract is defined by a special address that is cryptographically determined by the contract itself. [Learn more](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash). Funds are "in the contract" when they are sent to this special address. 

A contract consists of challenges, requirements that have to be met to access the funds stored in it.


### The Last Will contract
There are three challenges for the Last Will contract. 
Pseudo-code below shows the idea behind the smart contract:
```
contract LastWill()
{
    challenge refresh()
    {
        verify if the transaction 
        was signed by the creators refreshing wallet
        
        verify if the transaction 
        send all funds from the contract address
        back to the same contract address
    }
    
    challenge cold()
    {
        verify if the transaction 
        was signed by the creators cold wallet
     }
     
    challenge inheritor()
    {
        verify if the transaction 
        was signed by the inheritors wallet

        verify if 6 months have passed 
        since the funds were sent to the contract
    }
}
```
*refreshing* challenge sends funds from the contract back to the contract, effectively **resetting the timer** that *inheritor* challenge measures.

*inheritor* challenge lets your inheritor collect the money from the contract when the money age reaches 6 months.

*cold* challenge lets you spend your funds any time you like.

Contract security model relies on the certainty that the refreshing wallet can do you no harm, even if it's private key is stolen. Refreshing the contract is relatively frequent activity therefore it should not bring any risk. Even if you find yourself on the run, and the only computer available in an old pc in an algierian library, you should be able to send your contract a message **"I'm still alive"** safely and irrepressibly, without any risk of losing funds due to that. 

If your refreshing wallet get stolen, the only thing that the attacker can do is to refresh your contract, reset your timer. You can then end the contract from your cold wallet and create another one, with the different refreshing wallet. If you die with your refreshing key stolen, funds are not stolen. Your inheritor might never get the inheritance. So the actual worse case scenario is an expected result of simply **not using** the Last Will contract at all [(see Quadriga exchange story)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47203706) or using the conventional, custodial and trusted last will and testament solutions.

Smart contract is not a standard transaction. To see it with your wallet you need the plugin.

Full code of the contract written with [spedn](https://spedn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) language can be found [here](LastWill.spedn)

## Refresh lock

There is a lock for refreshing, you can't do it for the first 7 days after creation or refreshing of the contract, so that no one, who have stolen your refreshing wallet can drain your funds to transaction fees by refreshing it a million times, over and over.

## Installing the plugin
First, download and verify the last-will-plugin-vVERSION.zip file from [relesases](https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Electron-Cash-Last-Will-Plugin/releases). Then go to your Electron Cash and install the plugin.
![install](/pictures/installing.png)
![add](/pictures/add_plugin.png)
The plugin will appear as one of the tabs.


## Creating a Last Will contract
In the plugin tab you will see three buttons.
![intro](/pictures/intro.png)

Click *Create Last Will contract* to create a new contract.
Fill the fields.

![creating](/pictures/creating.png)

After pressing **create** button you will see a pop-up asking for confirmation. If you confirm will make an initial transaction, that sends dust to your cold wallet, inheritors wallet and refreshing wallet, has a contract address and contract version in OP_RETURN output and sends the amount you have chosen to the contract address. Your contract is now created

## Licho Notification Service (Inactive)

The creator of this software Karol Trzeszczkowski (Licho) provides an optional e-mail notification service, that you can order through the plugin.

6 months is quite a **long period of time**, it's possible to forget about refreshing your contract. To solve this problem Licho offers the **notification service**. For a small fee Licho will send you an **e-mail reminder** a week before your contract expiry date.

The notification service is also a solution to the issue, that a wallet without the plugin installed can't see the contract. This means that your inheritor won't know about the contract unless they checked. When you pass away and your contract expire, Licho may **let your inheritor know** about the Last Will contract waiting to be claimed.

If you decide to order an e-mail notification, a transaction will be created. It will be of the value of the fee for the services and it will have an encrypted email address attached as the OP_RETURN data. For the inheritor notification, an encrypted e-mail and the contract address will be attached. 

## Refreshing the contract
From your refreshing wallet, in the Last Will tab click *Find existing Last Will contract*. You'll see your contract information and and an option to setup a notification service for the next refreshing period.

![refreshing](/pictures/refresh.png)

Click on *Refresh* button and you will see a refresh transaction window. Broadcasting it will inform your contract that you are alive and postpone execution of your will for the next six months.

## Ending the contract

From your "watch only" wallet, in the Last Will tab click *Find existing Last Will contract*. You will see an option to export your contract information. (Every refreshing obsoletes the exported information so make sure you have a fresh info file for the next step.)

![export](/pictures/export.png)

Then, go to your cold storage, install the plugin and *Load Last Will contract info*. You'll see the same contract management tab as after clicking *Find existing Last Will contract* but without the need to be connected to the internet. Now you can click *End contract* and save the transaction. Save it and take to a computer connected to the internet. in Electron Cash window click *Tools*>*Load Transaction*, load and broadcast the transaction generated on your cold machine.



## Inheriting

If you are inheritor and you suspect you've inherited Bitcoin Cash with the Last Will contract, you need to install the plugin in your Electron Cash, click *Find existing Last Will contract* and click *Inherit*. A transaction window, that will send the money from the contract to your address will appear.

After broadcasting the transaction to the network, money should appear in your wallet. If you get an error while trying to broadcast the transaction, you probably have to wait some time for the contract to expire, as the time

## Special thanks

I want to thank **Mark Lundeberg** for solving the vast majority of my problems. I would never get this to work if he wasn't there to help me. I based on his work a lot. The Last Will plugin is a ship of theseus<sup>[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)</sup> [coinsplitter](https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Coinsplitter-Plugin) that I modified until it stopped to quack like a duck.<sup>[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test)</sup>

I also want to thank to **Pein_Sama** for help with spedn and his [famous article](https://honest.cash/pein_sama/spending-constraints-with-op_checkdatasig-172).

I also want to credit **Tobias Ruck** for his idea of looping transactions.
